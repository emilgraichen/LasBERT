## What is this?
This is a Swedish Lexical Simplification system developed for the Bachelor's Thesis "Context-aware Swedish Lexical Simplification". The simplifier takes Swedish sentences, identifies complex words, and replaces them with a synonym if the synonym has a lower complexity score than the original word.
